>>Food Recognition and Calorie Estimation:

This project provides a food recognition and calorie estimation system that uses machine learning and computer vision to identify food items
from images and estimate their caloric content. It offers a user-friendly interface for inputting food images and receiving nutritional insights.

>>Features:

- **Food Recognition**: Accurately identifies a wide range of food items using advanced deep learning models.
- **Calorie Estimation**: Estimates the caloric content of recognized food items based on nutritional information.
- **User Interface**: Simple interface for uploading or capturing food images and receiving instant feedback.
- **Customizable Database**: Easily update the food database to include new items or adjust nutritional data.

>>Applications:

- **Health and Fitness**: Helps users track calorie intake and manage their diet more effectively.
- **Nutritional Analysis**: Provides insights into food consumption patterns and nutritional content.
- **Food Industry**: Enhances customer experience by integrating with apps or services offering nutritional information for menu items.

>>How It Works

1. **Image Input**: Users upload or capture an image of food through the system's interface.
2. **Food Classification**: The system uses pre-trained deep learning models to classify the food item based on visual features.
3. **Calorie Calculation**: After identifying the food item, the system retrieves nutritional information and estimates the calorie content.
4. **Results Display**: The estimated calorie count and food classification are presented to the user.

>>Installation

>Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy, Flask (or other web framework)

>>Installing Dependencies
You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:
```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy flask

 >>Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/NagaRaghuram/food-recognition-calorie-estimation.git
cd food-recognition-calorie-estimation

>>Usage
-Start the Server: Run the following command to start the web server:
python app.py
-Upload an Image: Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to access the application. Upload or capture a food image to get the classification and calorie estimation.

>>Future Enhancements
-Expanded Food Database: Include more food items and improve calorie estimation accuracy.
-Integration with Fitness Apps: Connect with fitness tracking apps for comprehensive dietary management.
-Real-Time Recognition: Enhance the system to handle video feeds for dynamic food recognition.
-Personalized Recommendations: Develop features to suggest healthier food options based on user preferences and dietary goals.
